# Overview
I made this code after first learning loops in C#. It utilises while loops to give a user a certain amount of attempts to input a valid username and password, and if they do not input a valid entry in the attempts given, they will be kicked out of the system. 

Depending on the username and password they enter, they can access the regular user portal, for everyday users, or the admin portal, which can, for example, grant them special features and/or access to certain things.
